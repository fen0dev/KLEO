# KLEO
 Advanced Python-built malware with sophisticated stealthy & obfuscated techniques.

# Summary of Techniques and Sophistication

 1. Multi-layer Encoding/Decoding

    Purpose: Obfuscation and concealment of critical data.
    Techniques: Uses XOR encryption, Base64 encoding, and zlib compression to encode and decode data such as server IP, port, and other configuration details.
    Impact: Makes reverse engineering and detection more difficult.

2. Persistence Mechanisms

    Registry Modification: Adds the malware executable to the Windows registry to ensure it runs at startup.
    Startup Folder: Copies itself to the startup folder.
    Service Installation: Installs itself as a Windows service.
    Impact: Ensures the malware persists across system reboots and user logins.

3. Anti-Analysis Techniques

    Anti-Debugging: Checks for the presence of debugging tools and if the process is being debugged.
    Anti-VM: Detects common virtual machine signatures to avoid running in a virtualized environment.
    Sandbox Detection: Looks for artifacts associated with sandbox environments.
    Timing Analysis: Uses timing discrepancies to detect if it's running in a controlled analysis environment.
    Impact: Avoids detection and analysis by security researchers and automated tools.

4. Stealth Features

    Console Hiding: Hides the console window to avoid user detection.
    Background Execution: Runs the malware as a background process.
    Impact: Reduces the likelihood of detection by the user.

5. Remote Command and Control

    Network Communication: Connects to a remote server using either plain TCP or SSL, depending on configuration.
    Command Execution: Receives and executes commands from the server, including file upload/download, directory changes, and system commands.
    Impact: Allows remote control and data exfiltration.

6. Data Exfiltration and System Control

    File Transfer: Capable of uploading and downloading files to/from the remote server.
    Command Execution: Executes arbitrary system commands and returns the output to the server.
    Impact: Provides extensive control over the infected machine and facilitates data theft.

7. Information Gathering

    Screenshot Capture: Takes screenshots and sends them to the server.
    Webcam Capture: Captures images from the webcam.
    Audio Recording: Records audio from the microphone.
    Impact: Gathers sensitive information from the user.

8. Keylogging

    Keyboard Listener: Records keystrokes and periodically sends the log to the server.
    Impact: Captures passwords, messages, and other sensitive information typed by the user.

9. Modular Design

    Separate Modules: Uses imported modules for specific tasks like password extraction and process hollowing.
    Impact: Enhances functionality and modularity, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

# Sophistication

The script demonstrates a high level of sophistication due to its use of multiple advanced techniques:

    Obfuscation: Multi-layer encoding to hide critical information.
    Persistence: Multiple methods to ensure it runs automatically on startup.
    Anti-analysis: Several checks to detect and evade debugging, virtual machines, and sandbox environments.
    Stealth: Measures to hide its presence from the user.
    Remote Control: Comprehensive command-and-control capabilities for remote operation and data exfiltration.
    Information Theft: Various methods to capture and exfiltrate sensitive data, including keylogging, screenshots, webcam capture, and audio recording.

These features indicate that the malware is designed to be resilient, difficult to detect, and capable of extensive control over an infected system, making it a powerful tool for malicious actors.

# Considerations
Please, use this piece of software for educational purposes only. Hacking is illegal and unethical. The writer of this malware (myself) assumes no responsibilities in case of misuse by anyone using it. Do not harm anybody, instead have fun playing around with it in a virtual environment and get to learn cybersecurity better. 

As always, happy coding! :)
